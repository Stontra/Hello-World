# Tesla Stock Analysis Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Tesla Stock Analysis project! This repository is my exploration into the world of stock analysis, particularly focused on Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). With a strong aptitude in mathematics but no formal background in coding or financial analysis, I've embarked on a journey to understand stock market trends and analysis techniques.

## Project Description

This project is a collection of scripts and notebooks that fetch historical stock data for Tesla, calculate various statistical measures, and perform seasonal decomposition to identify trends, seasonality, and residuals in the stock's performance over time.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer along with the following libraries:
- `yfinance` for fetching historical stock data.
- `plotly` for creating interactive visualizations.
- `statsmodels` for performing seasonal decomposition.

You can install these libraries using the following command:

pip install yfinance plotly statsmodels

perl


## Contents

This repository contains:
- `Tesla_Stock_Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that walks through the process of data fetching, analysis, and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the necessary Python libraries.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebook.
2. Ensure that you have the required libraries installed.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis in action.

## About Me

I am a self-taught enthusiast with a keen interest in stock market analysis. After taking an interest in my mathematical aptitude, I decided to apply these skills to understand and analyze the stock market, starting with one of the most interesting companies of our time - Tesla, Inc.
